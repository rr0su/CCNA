# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs – CCNA Portfolio

This repository contains **Cisco Packet Tracer labs** designed for **CCNA-level learning and practice**.  
Each lab is structured in a dedicated folder with `.pkt` files, step-by-step instructions, and notes to guide your learning.

These labs cover:

- Switching and VLANs  
- Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)  
- NAT & ACL configurations  
- DHCP & DNS setups  
- WAN technologies and PPP  

> ⚠️ Note: `.pkt` files are Cisco Packet Tracer files. You need [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer) to open and run them.
